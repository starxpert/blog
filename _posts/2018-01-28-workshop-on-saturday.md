# Workshop on Saturday

The flow of time is always cruel... its speed seems different for each person, but no one can change it... A thing that does not change with time is a memory of younger days... Ancient Creators of Hyrule! Now, open the sealed door and send the Evil Incarnation of Darkness into the void of the Evil Realm!!  Listen! No... it was not the boy I underestimated, it was the Triforce of Courage. What's that? Oh. So you've got a Deku Shield... 

It's dangerous to go alone! Take this. Dodongo dislikes smoke. WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS USE FIRE. It's a secret to everybody. Grumble, grumble. 

I am not stinky! I take a bath at least once a month!  I...I shall consume. Consume...Consume everything.  A puppet that can no longer be used is mere garbage.  Milk... It's miiiilk... Can you get tipsy from something like milk?!? Hic!  Whenever there's a meeting, a parting is sure to follow. However, that parting need not last forever. Whether a parting be forever or merely for a short time. . . That is up to you.  

AAAAAAAAAAAH! A GERUDO!!!! Wha-? A mask? Why do you have a mask like that?!  Heh heh heh... You want a piece of me?! Very funny! I like your attitude! And what's THAT? Is that the Kokiri Sword? GOOD GRIEF!!! Can Hyrule's destiny really depend on such a lazy boy? ! Who...? Who are you? How did you get past the guards? 

It was a prosperous land, blessed with green forests, tall mountains, and peace... But then, a day came when a fell wind began to blow across the kingdom... Are you him? Are you the one who was speaking through my stone without my permission? Answer me! But then, when all hope had died and the hour of doom was at hand, a young boy in green appeared as if from nowhere... With its strength, he commanded darkness across the kingdom... 

If a person who has an evil heart gets the Triforce, a Hero is destined to appear... and he alone must face the person who began the Great Cataclysm. If the evil one destroys the Hero, nothing can save the world from his wicked reign. Only a person of the Knights Of Hyrule, who protected the royalty of Hylia, can become the Hero... Well, my mind is getting hazy... Please let me hear the sound of the flute one last time. The man who last claimed the Power Of Gold wished for this world. It reflects his heart. Yes, I came here because of greed for the Golden Power, and look what happened to me... But what a mischievous thing to leave lying around... The Power Of Gold... Triforce... You are perhaps the last one to carry on the blood-line of the Knights... It is ironic that the last one in the line has the potential to become the Hero of legend.
