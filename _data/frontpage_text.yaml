- mission: The Pacific Rim Experiences for Undergraduates (PRIME) program was created in 2004 to provide a project-based, hands-on research internship program combined with an experience in international cultural awareness for science and engineering undergraduates at the University of California, San Diego. PRIME grew out of the PRAGMA collaborative project framework and people network. PRIMEâ€™s projects are also facilitated through additional collaborations between UC San Diego and international researchers outside the PRAGMA network.
