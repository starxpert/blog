Supporting PRIME is accomplished through the participation of many UC San Diego units as well as the sites that host our students. Support for the students and coordinating the program comes from several sponsors and partners.

**UCSD Participating Units** include:

* International Center, which prepares and delivers the curriculum for the cultural preparation and reflection workshops;
* Academic Internship Program provides the students with a means to receive academic credit for their PRIME experience;
* Academic Departments and Organized Research Units are the homes of the UC San Diego mentors who guide the students in preparing for their Pacific Rim research experiences.

**Host Sites** provide research infrastructure to conduct the project and the mentors to guide the students during their stay. They also help identify housing and help the students become accustomed to their stay at the host site.
