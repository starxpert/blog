The application process consists of identifying a mentor at UCSD (see the People tab), working with the mentor to develop a project, and completing the application form (see Quick Link to Submit Full Application). This entails doing your homework **before meeting the mentor** to know what previous projects or current interests are and to read some of the mentor’s publications. Meet the mentor, who will likely assign you to read some materials. After you have read the materials, you will want to speak with the mentor again about what interests you!

Mentors look for a mixture of talent, background (courses), enthusiasm, initiative and eagerness to learn and work.

The PRIME application is a two-part process. You must download and then submit a: [Preliminary Application](http://prime.ucsd.edu/applications-scholarhips/2015_prime_preliminary_application.docx) and a [Full Application](http://prime.ucsd.edu/applications-scholarhips/2015_prime_final_application.docx)

The full application checklist consists of six components:

A. Internship Application Summary Information

1. Personal Details
2. Permanent Contact Information
3. Emergency Contact Information
4. Statement of Eligibility
5.	UCSD and Host Mentor Information
6. Professional References

B. Personal Statement

The personal statement should address "why" you are interested in the program, what you hope to achieve from this experience, and what your long-term professional plans are. The statement would include any relevant background experience. Remember that this statement often serves as your writing sample; please make sure that it is well written (500 words or less), edited and checked for spelling.

C. Proposed Set of Activities

Please provide a short description of your proposed set of activities. This should include a rationale for the project, possible (desired) outcomes, and approaches to achieve the outcomes.

### Expectations of Successful Applicants

In addition to the rules contained in the eligibility criteria above, PRIME has additional expectations of successful applicants to the program. Among them:

* We strongly recommend applicants have completed at least two years at UCSD or other university.
* Students accepted into the program receive support to supplement the costs of airfare, housing, food and incidental expenses. Most students selected to participate in PRIME will need to use personal funds for non-supplemented expenses. Students are encouraged to apply for UCSD scholarships! Funds from these scholarships will be used to pay for supported costs of the program.
* Selected students commit to spent at least four hours per week during Spring Quarter, working with their mentors, in preparation for the research experiences abroad.
* Many alumni of the PRIME program are willing to assist current PRIME students, for example, by participating in upcoming information sessions. Looking ahead, the PRIME 2014 Information Session will take place in early January 2014, and the PRIME Expectations Workshop will be scheduled for May 2014. Any alumni who want to participate are urged to contact Teri Simas [here](mailto:tgraysimas@ucsd.edu).
