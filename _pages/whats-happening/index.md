The Pacific Rim Experiences for Undergraduates (PRIME) program was created in 2004 to provide a project-based, hands-on research internship program combined with an experience in international cultural awareness for science and engineering undergraduates at the University of California, San Diego. PRIME grew out of the PRAGMA collaborative project framework and people network. PRIME’s projects are also facilitated through additional collaborations between UC San Diego and international researchers outside the PRAGMA network.

## Why International?
Science is increasingly global and being pursued in more places than ever before. It is evident that the "architecture of world science" is evolving and expanding through global (people) networks. These international groups are "motivated by the bottom-up exchange of scientific insight, knowledge and skills, and the desire by scientists to work with the best people, institutions and equipment... (and) are changing the focus of science from the national to the global level"*. The growth of these grassroots networks has been enabled, in part, by the deployment of the physical communication networks that allow individuals to share information, insights, data and resources at a distance.

Business and industry are also forced to think and act globally, to recruit the best talent, and to compete with the rest.

We believe that students need to be immersed in an international experience as early as possible, in order to be able to succeed in the global marketplace of ideas. PRIME offers such an experience.

## Why Asia?

Some of the fastest growing economies are in Asia, and some of the greatest investments in research and its infrastructure are in Asia.

Asia is excitingly diverse, culturally rich, and contains roughly half of the world’s population. Much of Asia is on or near the Pacific Rim, as is the United States. The west coast of the United States has a sizable Asian population. While U.S. history and culture have long been Euro-centric, the reasons above point to future opportunities in Asia as our focus shifts toward this region. Students who are exposed to Asia and the Pacific Rim region sooner will also benefit sooner in professional development.

## Program Overview

The PRIME research internship takes place annually over a 30-week period that includes four phases:

* Admission Process (Winter Quarter): Application (a student-written internship project based on the research interest and expertise of the dual mentors), interview and placement process;
* Research and Cultural Preparation (Spring Quarter): On-campus, mentored research skill building and cultural competency development;
* Research and Cultural Internship (Summer): Summer internship at the host site and ongoing cultural competency development through weekly reflection essays; and
* Re-entry Activities (Fall Quarter): (a) Participating in workshops to systematically reflect on the international experience and to describe it meaningfully in a professional resume; (b) sharing the experience with other students during study-abroad info sessions, in meetings with student organizations and at UC San Diego’s Admit Day; and (c) continuing the research in the UCSD mentor’s laboratory with ultimate goal of publishing the research.

## Research Overview

The students’ internship projects range from structural biology, bioengineering, geosciences and visualization to earthquake engineering, computational chemistry, cultural heritage and more. Each student uses or develops components of cyberinfrastructure to complete his or her project. The work of previous students has led to the development of software products as well as to publications in peer-reviewed journals. Examples of students’ contributions have been highlighted in the PRAGMA Collaborative Overview (click on images below for most recent years’ overviews).
